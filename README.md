This repository demonstrates how to interface a stepper motor with the 8051 microcontroller using the **ULN2003** driver to handle the extra current required to run the motor. The project includes complete assembly code, Proteus simulation files, and documentation, along with screenshots and photos from testing.

## üì¶ **Project Overview**
The project showcases the integration of a stepper motor with the **AT89C51** microcontroller, part of the 8051 family. The stepper motor is driven via the **ULN2003** Darlington transistor array, which provides the necessary current amplification to drive the motor efficiently. The Proteus simulation files enable you to visualize and test the functionality before implementing it on hardware.

### **Key Features:**
- **Stepper Motor Control**: Smooth, precise motor control using the 8051 microcontroller.
- **ULN2003 Driver**: Utilized to supply the necessary current for stepper motor operation.
- **Proteus Simulation**: Includes simulation files for stepper motor interfacing with an 8051 MCU.
- **Test Results**: Screenshots and photos from actual tests provide insights into the project's performance.
